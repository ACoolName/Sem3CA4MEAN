    Overall functionality:
    In the front page you can enter the desired search string and press 'Search' and it will return the full list
    of results. If you hover your mouse over an item in the list for 5 seconds, a pop up with the 'abstract' will apprear.
    When you click on a item it will bring you to the view with details about that wiki. Clicking on a category inside
    the wiki details view, will take you to a page with all the wikis within that category.

    In the menu we also have a 'Category' entry. When you click on that it will take you to the all category page.
    The use of this page is easy and self explanatory.

<p>Who did what?
    As with the other projects we split our work into 2 groups of 2.
    Martin, Tobias and Teodor worked mostly on the back-end in the start and Raul
    worked on the front-end. Half way into the project we had enough things to do
    that everyone started working on the own parts of the project and did a little here
    and a little there which should be clear in the Github commit log.</p>


Design back-end:
We tried to make the back-end as robust and stable as possible. To achieve that goal we have used a
facade that would be the middle point between the REST api and the database.

Design front-end:
When it comes to the front-end, we divided every functionality into its folder/file. For example, for the directives,
there is a file for directives inside the components folder that handles all the directives.
The application is SPA and uses different routes for different views.


Testing
Testing is what we have focused more in this CA. We have three kind of tests: backend tests, end-to-end tests and front end
tests.

Backend tests uses Mocka together with Should to make sure we had consistent and quit tests that didn't interfere with
the real database. There is a database created only for these tests (mongodb://localhost/TestDataBase_MEAN).
Here, we are testing the REST API and our helper class wikis to ensure full functionality and stability.

End-to-end tests are full integration tests.

Front-end tests uses karma. We are testing everything in isolation and we mock the back-end to ensure the isolation test.
