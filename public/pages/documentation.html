<h1>Overall functionality</h1>

<p>
  In the front page you can enter the desired search string and press 'Search' and it will return the full list
  of results. If you hover your mouse over an item in the list for a little while, a pop up with the 'abstract' will
  appear.
  When you click on a item it will bring you to the view with details about that wiki. Clicking on a category inside
  the wiki details view, will take you to a page with all the wikis within that category.

  In the menu we also have a 'Category' entry. When you click on that it will take you to the all category page.
  The use of this page is easy and self explanatory.

  There is also an add wiki button in the menu that takes you to Part 4.1 of the CA. It is a fully functional wiki
  creation tool.

<h1>Who did what?</h1>

<p>
  In this project we did things a bit different, in the beginning Raul worked on the front-end
  while Martin worked on the back-end, Teodor worked on the api together with Tobias in pair programming
  so that he Teodor could learn more about testing. Tobias took the role of supervisor when he wasn't needed
  next to Teodor. During the project things did change and everyone worked and helped out on all parts of the project
  which should be apparent from Git. Git users are, Sallas = Tobias; Marto1 = Martin; stelescuraul = Raul; TeodorDumitru
  = Teodor.

<h1>Design back-end</h1>

<p>
  We tried to make the back-end as robust and stable as possible. To achieve that goal we have used a
  facade that would be the middle point between the REST api and the database.
</p>


<h1>Design front-end</h1>

<p>
  When it comes to the front-end, we divided every functionality into its folder/file. For example, for the directives,
  there is a file for directives inside the components folder that handles all the directives.
  The application is SPA and uses different routes for different views.
</p>


<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>
  Testing is what we have tried to focus the most on in this CA, and mostly the learning part of it.
  We have three kind of tests: backend tests, end-to-end tests and front-end tests.

  Backend tests uses Mocka together with Should to make sure we had consistent and quit tests that didn't interfere with
  the real database. There is a database created only for these tests (mongodb://localhost/TestDataBase_MEAN).
  Here, we are testing the REST API and our helper class wikis to ensure full functionality and stability.
  Some of these tests are in full isolation to prevent any coupling issues to interfere with the tests. This is done
  using sinon and it's stubbing features.

  End-to-end tests using protractor are full feature integration tests using a test database allowing us to insert,
  remove and check data.

  Front-end tests uses karma. We are testing most things in as much isolation as we can, fx the back-end is always mocked away
  using $httpBackened and we also used jasmines built in spyOn functionality to isolated certain tests.
  test.
