<p>Who did what?
    As with the other projects we split our work into 2 groups of 2.
    Martin and Tobias worked mostly on the back-end in the start and Teodor and Raul
    worked on the front-end. Half way into the project we had enough things to do
    that every started working on the own parts of the project and did a little here
    and a little there which should be clear in the Github commit log.</p>


Design back-end:

One of the most important principles in programming is DRY and during all of our
projects we try and design the structure and code in a way that we can abide to
this principle. The biggest examples of this is our abstract classes for our model
helper classes and the most common REST routes.


Testing

We decided to focus our testing on the different model helper classes
as most of the other code uses either code written for express or front end code which
we'll learn how to test next period.

We used Mocka together with Should and to make sure we had a consistent and quick tests
that also didn't interfere with any database we used mockgoose https://www.npmjs.org/package/mockgoose.
Mockgoose creates intercepts connection calls made by mongoose and redirect them to a
in memory "database" instead of relying on a mongodb database.
It handles most functionality that mongoose has, at least enough for this project.
To make sure of consistency we made a modified version of the import_database script that
we run before each test which allows us to reset the "database". We also used a smaller
dataset to ensure quick speed and a controlled test environment.
